As we all know, digital currency is based on blockchain technology and platform, and it is also the most typical application of blockchain, and it is not the only one.

Taking Bitcoin as an example, its platform provides the function of transferring funds between users, but it does not provide the functions of transaction and payment. As a result, Bitcoin cannot communicate with the outside world, let alone be truly circulated, and cannot become a real currency.

Digital currency exchange system development can be divided into the following three types from the transaction process:

1. Centralized exchange: Add or delete user asset fields in the exchange's own database.

2. Decentralized exchange: Exchange directly on the blockchain, and the cryptocurrency will be sent directly back to the user's wallet or a smart contract stored on the blockchain.

3. Semi-decentralized exchange: Cryptocurrencies are sent to the designated wallet of the exchange for matching transactions, and the actual controller of the wallet used for the transaction belongs to the exchange.

Regarding the front-end: First of all, the UI design of the front-end interface must conform to the preferences of the audience. If it is operated overseas, the distribution system must conform to the user's usage habits and aesthetics. After all, the front-end interface is the face of the exchange. Just like looking at people, the first thing you notice is appearance.

Regarding the matching engine: This part is the focus of the matching trading system, and the matching of buy and sell orders completely relies on this. Transactions are matched according to the principle of "price priority, time priority, same price, same price". The database matching function is slightly weaker. For virtual currency trading systems, memory matching combined with multi-machine hot backup is a technique currently used by major exchanges.

Regarding wallets: Basically, they are both hot and cold wallet storage. After the userâ€™s money on the platform reaches a certain amount, it is directly transferred to the cold wallet. Wallets are the most important security concern for trading systems. A more secure wallet solution will help build trust between users and cryptocurrency exchanges.

About the backend: In order to facilitate the operation and management of the trading party, the backend functions can be customized according to specific business needs, but generally include currency library settings, user management, order management, operational statistics, risk control management, financial management, transaction management, etc.
